 We will have to walk 500 meters Here is our Go Pro. So it has been 2 months since I joined and mostly the work is done from home now what do I do is a story for another video Today I get a message from my senior that our senior manager is coming to visit 
the Accenture office and he wants to meet the new joiners So now it was a time for a new experience it was an opportunity to meet my colleagues and see the campus so how could I let it go? So I went there (Accenture office, Gurugram)
 and let me take you along with me Today is the first day I am going to the office and I am going to take you all along  I am casually dressed but I know I should dress formally but as you know I am shifting to Gurugram so because of the flat hunting I don't have formals and shoes so I have worn this I will try my best to show you everything and I am very excited so let's take our bullet and go. We will do moto vlogging as well We are already a little late let's quickly go I have started the navigation it is showing around 30 mins now you can see Gurugram as well the area I am going in is called cyber city like all the offices of the big companies are there Accenture's office is also there there are a lot of offices of Accenture in Delhi But I have to go to our management consulting office  if you don't already know I am working as a management consulting associate at Accenture Now let's quickly go there. The weather is too bad today. [Song]  The weather is not good today it is very sunny it is 2 km away As you can see you have to go left for cyber city. And the sun is gone. So I am just a kilometer away from the Accenture office I am also going there for the first time  so I have no idea As soon as I reached there I saw big buildings I started searching where is the Accenture office so I started asking people I started asking the building number Is it this done? I need to ask someone I have no idea where am I going So as you can see the place looks something like this Where is the Accenture office? is it this? I have no clue Okay, so this is tower B and C I'll call someone Brother where are you? I am in front of building gate tower B&C where are you? "There you are, so infront of you" Where do we have to park Although it was very difficult to get parking. But at the end, it was done. Where can I park? I am very far from the office I will have to go walking Do you know where the bike parking is? you will have to park it outside I guess there is no bike parking facility inside If any person from tower B&C or Accenture is watching this please tell me where to park? This is a big problem now I will have to park it here Finally a long moto vlog Really sorry for that. Now I will show you my office we will have to walk 500 meters let's quickly go I had a bath and came  now I am sweating I spoke to one of my friends and I am supposed to go on the 10th floor I will have to take a visiting card because I am visiting for the first time a lot of people are watching now I asked people that I am a vlogger so can I shoot? so the answer is what you think it is So when you enter the corporate world you talk to your clients and seniors in mostly english So obviously english speaking skills are very important recently I was talking to one of my friends from the UK yeah a lot, with clients and in meetings and this was possible because of Cambly Cambly is the only app in India which provides one on one private  English classes and your tutors are native English speakers from different countries like Canada,UK,US If you can write and read English but you are not confident in speaking Cambly is for you you can choose from a variety of courses like personality development Business English etc tutors are friendly and supportive and it will help you improve your weak areas and no one will judge you we spoke with Cambly to get you a discount coupon you can talk to a native english speaker for 15 mins for just 29 rupees and you have to use my coupon "HS29"  and you can avail the offer I will give the link in the decription, it is worth it So videography was not allowed  So the videos I made was mostly where the camera was facing me there aren't a lot of office videos but you will get an idea let's show you the office tour so since I put my last video I have been getting messages like these like these are the people who have seen my Youtube videos I am whispering because i am in the office right now. So the managing director was present over there and there was a discussion going on and we clicked a picture and the picture will be visible on the screen then our managing director told to take all the new joiners for lunch So seniors took us to have lunch with them and obviously I was feeling awkward to shoot over there so I was not able to shoot much I'll show you what all I got when I was shooting everyone around me were asking  are you making Instagram stories? I told them that I have a Youtube channel they said it's good that you are doing something extra so I started feeling awkward but I shot as much as I could My first day is over and I am going towards my bike so they did not allow me to shoot inside So I haven't shot much I'll get the approval nobody should have a problem I'll post my personal videos So you all know Ajay he is my friend and our older viewers know that he is a very good friend he was living in our accomodation I came because I had some work You can see the camera over here another one over there Cameras are there, so you can guess.
