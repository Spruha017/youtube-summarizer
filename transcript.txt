 Frutsbasket is a series with a long history of misconceptions, and I'm about to prove to you that you're wrong about Frutsbasket. Let's get into it. So I'm guessing you've already heard or even watched Frutsbasket and due to the nature of the series, many people have stated that Frutsbasket is a reverse heron. It's a sequel to the 2001 anime, or even that our main character, Toru Honda, is a Mary Sue. Q. The Shocked Replies. So to understand better, let's quickly describe Frutsbasket for the Laman. Frutsbasket is a series based on the Shodho manga of the same name by Natsuki Takaya, released in 1998. It's inners around Toru Honda, a teenage girl who lost her mother to a sudden tragic accident, and is now forced to live on her own. But after being helped out by members of the Soma clan, Shigere, Yuki and Kiyosoma, she moves into their house under the condition that she continues to support herself and go to school. But after an accident with Kiyosoma, she finds out that they turn into animals of the Zodiac when hugged by the opposite sex. We automatically turn human again after a while. To keep the naked, I'm afraid. This is the first, in most crucial aspect of the series that people seem to get wrong in label Frutsbasket as a reverse heron. This is easily the most common misconception by far, and to this day I don't understand how one can come to this conclusion if you've watched the series. So the reason people likely call this a reverse heron is probably because they only read the synopsis on mail or looked at the promotional materials only. This can be proven by looking at all of the promotion materials from season 1. We see Toru, Frutton, and in the background, well, a bunch of very attractive looking men. To any person passing by, they would easily be able to form a misconception just around those visuals alone. The reality is so much different. There is a grand total of two men, vying for Toru's affection and season 1, season 2, there is but 1, and season 3, there is 2. Technically, now if this were actually a reverse heron, there would be three or more men trying to get with Toru. Plus, Toru Honda actually takes the back seat to other characters like Yuki Kyo, Ren, and Okito who at times are featured more often than Toru is featured. For example, season 2 focuses primarily on Yuki Soma who isn't even romantically interested in Toru Honda by that season, but someone else completely. So if you hear this from someone, make it move to politically correct them as this is what turns many people off to and otherwise amazing series. But did you know that Frutsbassker received an adaptation in 2001? That's correct. Adapted by studio dean, the adaptation is by today's standards outdated. But there is confusion as people think this 2001 anime is required to watch before the new anime. Instead, the new Frutsbassker anime aims to deliver an accurate adaptation of the original manga while modernizing it for a new generation of fans and viewers all around the world. So don't worry, there are no prerequisites to watch the new Frutsbassker series. But before we get to our last misconception, I would appreciate it if you gave this video a like. It shows that you want more content for me and while you're at it, comment on your favorite misconceptions from Frutsbassker or even other anime. I may make a bonus video if I get enough comments. As promised, the last misconception is that Toru Honda is a merry suit. Now while I would consider this right up there with Frutsbassker being a reverse heron, this is something more hardcore detractors of Frutsbassker would say. Not sure why those people would try to slander the name of our wholesome Toru Honda, but they exist and I runically enough they probably need Toru to give them a therapy session or two. So let's take an old trip down to, oh wait, this is a German to English book. Let's take a trip to Google where the definition is as follows. A type of female character who is depicted as unrealistically lacking in flaws or weaknesses. Now the only way to prove that Toru isn't a merry suit is to tell you the times she's not a merry suit, which is technically 100% of the series, but if I said that then I'd probably just be an asshole, which I swear I'm not. So for this example, I will aim to keep spoiler free for people who haven't seen it yet. My first example is when Toru gives her speech to Ritsu about not giving up even when life gets generally speaking, this is our first glimpse and how Toru works and feels. Toru while on the exterior looks like she has no troubles. The reality is that she's struggling with losing her mother. Toru at this moment has no reason to live because the reason she lived prior to this, her mother died in a tragic accident. So now she struggles to find her own place, her own reason to live again. And while she is in a dark moment in her life, she is not giving up hope that one day she will find another reason to live. Another example of Toru's flaws is how she'll act selflessly to a fault. This is something that happens throughout the series, which is which really is the whole example. No really, every time, especially in season one, she helps someone you start to realize that at no point does anyone help Toru in the same way she helps others. This is because Toru isn't open about her own struggles with others and decides to not burden others with her issues. The first time we see this is the beginning of the series, the first episode. When Toru refuses to live with her best friends, Uo Aura Hanna because she would feel like a burden to them. So all in all, these two examples put a nice green check mark besides flaws and weaknesses.
