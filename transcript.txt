 NARRATOR (VOICEOVER):
On a hot day in August, 1963, Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. Delivered a
speech that would define the Civil
Rights Movement and his legacy. This, of course, was
his "I Have a Dream" speech, delivered
on the steps of the Lincoln
Memorial during the March on
Washington for Jobs and Freedom. [MUSIC PLAYING] MARTIN LUTHER KING
JR. (VOICEOVER): I have a dream
that my four little children will one
day live in a nation where they will
not be judged by the color
of their skin, but by the content
of their character. I have a dream today. [APPLAUSE] NARRATOR (VOICEOVER):
The March on Washington served
as a massive push for economic and
political justice for
African-Americans. Held during the
years celebrating the 100th anniversary
of the Emancipation Proclamation,
crowds marched on the National
Mall to watch a variety of
musical performances and speeches.  [SINGING] NARRATOR (VOICEOVER):
Dr. King, a Baptist preacher and
prominent civil rights leader was
scheduled to speak towards the
end of the day, his debut on the
national stage. Up until that
point, King mostly addressed
small crowds at black
churches, rallies, or fundraisers. This time, he
would be seen by nearly 250,000
people on the ground as well as millions
at home watching on television. This was an
opportunity to reach a
wide audience and persuade
the public and the
government to take action against
racial injustice. [MUSIC PLAYING] The night
before, King worked with a close
group of advisors to get the speech
just right. They worked
through the night, settling on
a final draft in the pre-dawn
hours of August 28th. Interestingly,
the phrase, "I have a dream,"
a phrase he used in earlier speeches,
was nowhere to be found in this copy. The words
wouldn't manifest until almost halfway
into Dr. King's speech, when gospel
singer Mahalia Jackson, who had
performed earlier in the day,
called out to him from the sidelines
to "tell them about the dream." King set his prepared
remarks aside and improvised
the rest, crafting a soaring
speech that was seared into the
minds of millions of Americans. MARTIN LUTHER KING
JR. (VOICEOVER): No, we are
not satisfied. And we will not
be satisfied until justice
rolls down like waters and
righteousness like a mighty stream. [APPLAUSE] NARRATOR (VOICEOVER):
The speech was divided
into two parts. The first listed
the injustices that
African-Americans faced-- segregation,
police brutality, disenfranchisement,
and discrimination-- and urged a call to
nonviolent action. The second launched
into King's dream of peace and racial
harmony, a vision of a future in which
people will not be judged by the color
of their skin, but by the content
of their character. MARTIN LUTHER KING
JR. (VOICEOVER): I have a dream. NARRATOR (VOICEOVER):
Highlighting King's skills as a preacher,
"I Have a Dream" was part sermon and
part poetry, using rhetorical
devices like repetition,
rhyme, and vivid
metaphor to drive his points home. It was peppered with
historic, biblical, and literary
references that moved the crowd. This message of
struggle and hope became the defining
moment not only of King's career,
but also the Civil
Rights Movement. [MUSIC PLAYING] Both the speech
and the March on Washington
were credited with helping
secure the passage of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, a landmark piece
of legislation that ended segregation
and banned discrimination on the
basis of race or sex in the workplace.
[MUSIC PLAYING] MARTIN LUTHER KING
JR.: Free at last-- CROWD MEMBER: Yes!
- --free at last. Thank God almighty,
we are free at last. [APPLAUSE] NARRATOR (VOICEOVER):
The speech also resonated
with activists around the globe. "I have a dream," the
phrase that wasn't even meant to be
in its final draft, appeared in
political actions all around the world. It's considered one
of the world's most transformative
and influential speeches, alongside
others like Abraham Lincoln's
"Gettysburg Address" and Winston
Churchill's "Blood, Toil,
Tears and Sweat." "I Have a Dream"
is only one of Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr.'s many achievements. But it's
nonetheless one of the most pivotal.  I am happy to
join with you today in what will go
down in history as the greatest
demonstration for freedom
in the history of our nation. [APPLAUSE]
