And if you think about it, not much has changed, we continue to make big decisions.They were in fact lessons on life that we will take with us forever.The depth of knowledge and experience that we have shared together in those boxes, lunch, the friends, coffee chats, and French schools, and our several nightouts together, those interactions will be priceless and unforgettable.I would like to thank Professor Kastaluchi, who pushed us to think beyond our boundaries in understanding ourselves human behavior in pursuing our ambition that truly defines who we are and ultimately guiding us to becoming extraordinary managers.I would like to thank Professor Gati and Sironi for reaffirming their faith in financial integrity and ethical conduct.I would like to thank Professor Davary and Jovac's fiery debates on the World Macro Economic Environment that today is so governed and impact our decisions.Thank you and good luck.15 months have passed, and it feels like yesterday that we took the most important decision of our lives.A dream for most of us before it even began, a dream that we all lived through during write turbulent times.However, it was a dream that we have all fulfilled, and today we stand here awakened and inspired only to dream bigger.But today there is a difference.Finally, a heartfelt thank you to all the families that are here today and those that were not able to make it.
