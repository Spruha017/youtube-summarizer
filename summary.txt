Day by day, early in the morning, 6 a.m.And by day 22 I opened my eyes and the first thing I did was say “Mom” “please don’t forget 
to make my bed today”.Even on days
I was running late, I got up every morning
and I made my bed.You have to incorporate 
certain habits in your life that all eventually lead to you becoming the best version of yourself.You also have to eliminate certain habits that are hindering your path.The difference in time
it took to form a habit was largely due to the task itself, the person, and their circumstances, as some were able to form the habit
within 18 days while other is took 254 days.Number one, is the complexity of your goal If I decide to start eating fruit daily which is considered a simple habit, I’d probably take less time than if I want to acquire
a complex athletic skill, like a tennis serve.I know that sounds very exciting, but there are actually a few factors
you’d have to consider to be able to estimate the time
and it will take you to form a new habit or to get rid of an old toxic one.Actually, that will give you time not to rush yourself into things, you have to give yourself time and not just rush yourself
into becoming a better version.I remember once in highschool, when my teachers told me: “It takes exactly 21 days for me to form a new habit”.And I thought, okay, maybe I’m just gonna be
a little bit worse at life than bed makers.I thought that
for the next 21 days, instead of getting up every day
and yelling: “Mom, please don’t forget
to make my bed today”.
