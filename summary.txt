But coming back
to Zomato delivery partners.I want to know more about 
Zomato delivery partners.What's going to happen in India 
in the next ten years, let a lot of this money reach you
and Zomato delivery partners.I think all the GenZ's and people on my 
team, they notice innovation on Zomato app Do you agree?
When you open Zomato app
yourself What do you think as a founder?So you tell me
from business perspective which business legend
would you like to see on TRS?We do very little business oriented
conversations on TRS because honestly not all of you watch entrepreneurship 
conversations, but today's guest is Indian entrepreneurship legend,
Zomato founder, Deepinder Goyal.If you were 22 years old today and you
want to enter into startups Would you do something like
Zomato style again?I like
business conversations very much.But we do very few business conversations
because honestly, we don't get views 
on business conversations.If you want to open big businesses 
in life, do a lot of things, watch this podcast till the end from a 
business or start up oriented perspective.We look for good people, then we work
on them; atleast the mid to senior Level.
