  NARRATOR (VOICEOVER):
On a hot day in August, 1963, Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. I have a dream today. Interestingly,
the phrase, "I have a dream,"
a phrase he used in earlier speeches,
was nowhere to be found in this copy. MARTIN LUTHER KING
JR. (VOICEOVER): No, we are
not satisfied. MARTIN LUTHER KING
JR. (VOICEOVER): I have a dream. It was peppered with
historic, biblical, and literary
references that moved the crowd. Thank God almighty,
we are free at last.
